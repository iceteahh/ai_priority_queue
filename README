# Video Processing Priority Queue

A high-performance, priority-based queue implementation in Go for scheduling and processing video ads.  
Supports multiple priorities, FIFO ordering within priorities, anti-starvation, and concurrent dequeue operations.

## Features

- **Priority-based processing** — Higher priority ads are processed first.
- **FIFO within priority levels** — Items with the same priority are processed in arrival order.
- **Anti-starvation mechanism** — Older low-priority ads can be promoted or processed to prevent indefinite waiting.
- **Maximum wait time enforcement** — Ads can define a `MaxWaitTime` in seconds; they’ll be processed once they exceed it.
- **Game family index** — Fast reprioritization and filtering by `GameFamily`.
- **Time index** — Quick lookups of ads based on enqueue time.
- **Concurrent processing** — Designed to work with multiple workers.
- **Metrics** — Get distribution of ads by priority.
